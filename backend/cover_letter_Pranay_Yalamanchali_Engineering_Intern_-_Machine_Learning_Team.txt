Dear Machine Learning Team at Rippling,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Engineering Intern position on your Machine Learning Team for Winter 2026. The opportunity to develop and implement machine learning models that directly enhance how businesses manage HR, IT, and Finance through a unified system deeply resonates with my passion for creating impactful AI solutions.

My upcoming role as a Software Engineering Intern at a stealth AI and supply chain startup has prepared me well for the challenges of implementing machine learning at scale. In this position, I will be working directly with AI infrastructure, gaining hands-on experience in translating complex business requirements into practical AI implementations. This experience aligns perfectly with your need for someone who can develop mathematical formulations from product needs and implement them as scalable solutions. The startup environment has taught me the importance of ownership and innovation, values that I see reflected strongly in Rippling's culture.

As the maintainer of UCSD Historical Enrollment, I have developed expertise in building and improving data pipelines that process large volumes of information efficiently. Using Python, I created robust data processing workflows and visualization tools that transformed raw enrollment data into actionable insights for thousands of students. This experience has given me practical knowledge in designing scalable systems and working with data preprocessing challenges, skills that directly transfer to building ML pipelines at Rippling. The project required close collaboration with various stakeholders and continuous iteration based on user feedback, demonstrating my ability to work effectively in team environments while taking ownership of technical solutions.

My proficiency in Python, demonstrated across multiple projects, provides a strong foundation for working with the ML stack at Rippling. Whether implementing data processing algorithms or creating visualization tools, I have consistently leveraged Python's capabilities to deliver efficient, maintainable solutions. This technical foundation, combined with my experience in data pipeline development, positions me well to contribute meaningfully to your team's efforts in advancing Rippling's machine learning capabilities.

I am particularly drawn to Rippling's commitment to growth through mentorship and fostering an environment of collaboration and diversity. The opportunity to learn from experienced ML engineers while contributing to products that simplify complex business operations across multiple domains excites me greatly. I would welcome the chance to discuss how my experience with AI infrastructure and data pipeline development can contribute to Rippling's mission of revolutionizing business management systems.

Sincerely,
Pranay Yalamanchali
