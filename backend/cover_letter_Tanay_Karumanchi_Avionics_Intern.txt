Dear Avionics Team at Astranis,

I am writing to express my strong interest in the Avionics Intern position at Astranis. The opportunity to contribute to building and testing flight hardware for software-defined satellites that bring connectivity to underserved communities worldwide deeply resonates with my passion for aerospace engineering and creating meaningful impact through technology.

As Payload Design Lead for the Ohlone Rocketry Team, I have gained hands-on experience directly relevant to your avionics hardware development needs. In this role, I led the design and integration of complex PCB systems and sensor arrays for our rocket payload, collaborating closely with cross-functional teams including propulsion, structures, and recovery. This experience taught me the importance of rigorous testing protocols and iterative design processes, skills I would bring to debugging and evaluating satellite hardware at Astranis. Working with tight deadlines and limited resources, I developed creative solutions to technical challenges while maintaining high standards for reliability and performance.

My role as Circuit Analysis Teaching Assistant at Ohlone College has further strengthened my foundation in electrical engineering fundamentals and troubleshooting techniques. Through this position, I regularly guide students through complex circuit debugging processes and help them master the use of testing equipment such as oscilloscopes and multimeters. This teaching experience has sharpened my ability to break down complex problems systematically and communicate technical concepts clearly, skills essential for collaborative engineering environments.

Additionally, my proficiency in both C/C++ and Python positions me well to contribute immediately to writing code for evaluating and automating satellite hardware testing. I have applied these programming skills in various projects, from embedded systems programming to data analysis, giving me the versatility to adapt to different testing and automation challenges.

I am particularly drawn to Astranis's mission of democratizing internet access through innovative satellite technology. The company's emphasis on hands-on learning and collaborative innovation aligns perfectly with my approach to engineering challenges. I am excited about the prospect of contributing to meaningful projects that directly impact global connectivity while learning from your experienced team of engineers. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my hardware development experience, programming skills, and passion for aerospace can contribute to Astranis's groundbreaking work.

Sincerely,
Tanay Karumanchi
